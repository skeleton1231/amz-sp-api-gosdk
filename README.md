## Selling Partner API Models
This repository contains Swagger models for developers to use to create software to call Selling Partner APIs. Developers can use [swagger codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) to generate client libraries from these models. Please refer to [selling-partner-api-docs](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs) for additional documentation and read the [Selling Partner API Developer Guide](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-docs/blob/main/guides/en-US/developer-guide/SellingPartnerApiDeveloperGuide.md) for instructions to get started.

The [models directory](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-models/tree/main/models) contains all of the currently available Selling Partner API models.

The amz-sp-api-gosdk is a Go software development kit (SDK) for working with the Amazon Selling Partner API for authorization, catalog items, catalog item attributes, fulfillment inbound shipment, and more. This SDK is based on the Swagger Codegen tool and uses generated client code from the Selling Partner API Swagger specification. The SDK provides easy-to-use methods for interacting with the Selling Partner API and handles the underlying HTTP requests and responses. It also supports common authentication methods for accessing the API, including the use of LWA access and refresh tokens. The SDK is designed to be easily integrated into Go projects and provides a convenient way for Go developers to work with the Selling Partner API.
